This is my first attempt at understanding the inner workings of the dcpu16 cpu written by notch. I barely understand cpu programming besides what I've read in textbooks and have basically copied all this code from other rather intelligent people. However to actually assist in me understanding what's going on I've opted to write this thing in lua since no one else has done so as of yet. I'm using swetland's c implementation as a reference point. Lua is missing a lot of built in functions that you would get in other languages such as bitwise operations and switch/case statements. Nevertheless its been entirely amusing and a huge enjoyment to try make this work. It's still broken but I hope soon will come to life.
